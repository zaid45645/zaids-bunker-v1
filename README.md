I made the website using vanilla HTML and CSS emphazising and working more on the asthetic part of the webstite
and overall just focusing on the design and the looks. Other than that the website is composed of content about me 
and stuff that I adore. Talking about the design, I went with a light background and dark and suitable font and also 
added extra stuff like buttons and images!
